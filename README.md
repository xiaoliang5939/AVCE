This week I finished modeling object text. I used blender to model the text in the same way I created brushes.


I chose to model the text as: moon, mouth, cloud, water, rain, wood.(月、口、云、水、雨、木)

During the process of making this 3d model, I learned how to create brushes in blender and became proficient in adjusting the pressure of the brushes.

In this week's group discussion, I poured the modeled 3d text separately and gave it to Yining, who imported our modeled text into unity.

# Week 7

On the basis of the Zhou's flow chart, a complete flow chart is added and prepared for the full pdf later.

Also, this week I need to make an in-game hint style.


During the design process, I wanted to make the prompts more specific to our game. For this purpose I refer to some styles of ancient Chinese calligraphy


<img width="447" alt="image" src="https://github.com/xiaoliang5939/AVCE/assets/76156342/d671d6e3-c6d2-4db2-ac45-b9cda7827b14">

I want to try to use calligraphy to present the English style


<img width="973" alt="image" src="https://github.com/xiaoliang5939/AVCE/assets/76156342/90111f0e-ac00-40e7-ae93-485a1615a888">


However, because I have not learned calligraphy professionally, I have already learned the difference between English and Chinese writing, and I think the effect is not good. So I thought maybe I could use some elements of calligraphy as a background for the hint, so I referred to some elements of radicals in calligraphy.


<img width="614" alt="image" src="https://github.com/xiaoliang5939/AVCE/assets/76156342/4a2d7ffc-8de4-4a3d-85a0-6727f889ae91">

Based on this, I chose the radicals as the cue background and drew a different background for each cue.

Conduct the first group test. The participants of this test are：Yining Jiang 、Zhou Fang、 Xiao Liang。


We chose dark lab as the final filming location.And since our work requires darts at the screen, we need to make our own safe screens.After many attempts, we chose to use the school table as a projection screen after standing up.As for the occlude, we need to occlude the screen so that it doesn't reveal the magnetic board behind it, but it also needs to be able to attach the magnetic dart to it.I went to the market and finally chose white curtains.

For this test, we tested the feasibility of homemade screens, and together we tested the sensor part.

# Week 8

This week I studied the background music for our game.Since the theme of our game is about traditional Chinese characters, I hope to find suitable music with Chinese characteristics.While searching, I found that although they were all classical Chinese music, they sounded very different in terms of emotional content.Some music is too big for our game, and some music is too sad for our game.Out of a lot of music, I finally chose "Jiangshangqingfeng" and "Pingxuyufeng" as the background music for the game.

Also this week, we learned how to create sound effects for our games ourselves. We need exactly three sound effects for our game, namely the bow sound, the bow sound, and the darts sound.I found it difficult to simulate the special effects of drawing and releasing the bow.Because he needed something very elastic and tough as a simulation, I used sticks and plastic bags to simulate, but the effect was not ideal.But Zhou used the collision of metal and wood to simulate the Foley of a dart hitting a darts sound.So we finally decided to use Zhou's Foley as the sound of a dart hitting a target.Then I found the right sound effects for bow drawing and archery on the Internet.

I also wrote a video script this week. We figured out what our video should be about and how long it would last.
